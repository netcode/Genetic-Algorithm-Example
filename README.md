Description
==============
This is simple implementation for genetic algorithm to find the value of 3 integers which its total equal givin value
and i added some coniditions that (y / 4) <= x <= (y/3) [x = guessed number , y = total]

the code based on simple code https://github.com/christophervalles/Basic-Genetic-Algorithm

Usage
=======

Edit the total value in index.php and simply run it
